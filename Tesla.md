# Tesla Commercial Projects

---

## 🔹 Option A — Tesla Powerwall 3 (clustered)

### What it looks like

* ~13.5 kWh per unit
* To hit ~300 kWh usable:

  * **22–24 Powerwall 3 units**
* Wall-mounted, distributed

### Clustered Approach difficulties. 

* Many discrete fire separation checks
* Complex placarding and shutdown logic
* Residential voltage architecture
* Harder to defend as a **single commercial asset** for ITC
* AHJs often push back once aggregation gets large

### When it *does* make sense

* Title 24 minimum only
* Per-unit backup
* Very small common loads

**Verdict:**
⚠️ *Technically possible, but not what you want for “21 units consumption” or ITC optimization.*

---

## 🔹 Option B — Tesla Megapack (recommended)

### What it is

**Tesla Megapack** is Tesla’s **commercial/utility-grade BESS**, and this is what fire departments, utilities, and tax advisors expect to see on a project like yours.

### Key specs (Megapack 2 XL – typical)

* ~3.9 MWh per unit (oversized for you, but scalable)
* Integrated PCS
* 480V / MV-ready
* UL 9540 system listed
* UL 9540A tested
* Designed explicitly for:

  * Fire department review
  * Centralized shutdown
  * Standalone ITC eligibility

### “But that’s way bigger than we need…”

Correct — **you would not install a full 4 MWh Megapack**.

Instead, you deploy:

* **A partial Megapack configuration**
* Or a **Tesla-integrator-provided skid derived from Megapack architecture**

Tesla integrators regularly deploy Megapack-based systems in the **300–500 kWh effective range** for:

* Multifamily
* C&I facilities
* Campus-style buildings

---

## Why Megapack is the right Tesla answer for 21 units

### 1️⃣ ITC clarity (huge win)

* Qualifies cleanly as **standalone energy storage**
* No solar-charging percentage gymnastics
* Entire skid eligible for **30% ITC**
* Clean depreciation and ownership structure

### 2️⃣ Fire-department friendly

* Single enclosure
* One emergency stop
* One placard set
* Clear setback envelope
* Tesla provides robust fire documentation

Fire reviewers *vastly* prefer this over 20+ wall batteries.

### 3️⃣ Operationally correct for 21 units

For your stated target:

| Target    | Recommended                      |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| Energy    | **300–350 kWh usable**           |
| Power     | **125–150 kW PCS**               |
| Coverage  | Evening peak + partial overnight |
| Expansion | Easy                             |

This aligns perfectly with a **small commercial skid** built on Megapack tech.

## Tesla-Only Recommendation (what I’d put in the proposal)

> **Primary Recommendation:**
> Tesla Megapack-based commercial BESS, sized to ~300–350 kWh usable capacity, configured as a standalone energy storage system to support 21 residential units’ diversified load, Title 24 compliance, and enhanced resiliency.

> **Alternate (Owner Preference):**
> Distributed Tesla Powerwall 3 system limited to Title 24 minimum storage requirements.

This lets the owner say “Tesla” **and** lets you protect the project technically.

## Bottom line (no fluff)

If the owner likes Tesla **and** you want:

* Clean fire approval
* Real resilience
* Maximum ITC
* A solution that scales with a 21-unit building

👉 **Use a Tesla Megapack-based commercial skid**, not a Powerwall cluster.

### Want me to:

* Draft **Tesla-specific proposal language**
* Show **Option A (Powerwall T24)** vs **Option B (Megapack ITC-optimized)** side-by-side
* Sketch a **Tesla one-line diagram**
* Estimate **ITC dollars recovered at 300 vs 350 kWh**

Say the word and I’ll build it exactly how you need it.


Tesla Megapacks are factory-assembled, utility‑scale battery enclosures that ship ready for rapid field installation, needing mainly foundations, AC terminations, communications, and then formal commissioning. [docs.planning.org](https://docs.planning.org.uk/20210319/202/QPV6H7SOJ8900/zisuxgvois9byi3q.pdf)

## What a Megapack includes
- Enclosure ships with battery modules, bi‑directional inverter, thermal management, AC main breaker, wiring, and protection already installed and tested in‑house. [impulsoragdl](https://impulsoragdl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ficha-Tecnica-Mega-Pack.pdf)
- It functions as a **turnkey** AC‑coupled unit, so no DC wiring is required onsite between batteries and inverter. [impulsoragdl](https://impulsoragdl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ficha-Tecnica-Mega-Pack.pdf)

## Site and civil requirements
- The EPC or installer must prepare foundations and provide seismic anchoring per Tesla’s Megapack System Installation Manual and local structural/seismic codes. [greenburghny](https://www.greenburghny.com/DocumentCenter/View/15305/Commissioning-Plan)
- Site work typically includes grading, fenced equipment yard, drainage, access roads, and clear working space and egress around each unit per fire code.

## Electrical and communications
- Once set, Megapack requires connection of AC conductors to the site transformer or switchgear and a communications cable for SCADA/controls. [docs.planning.org](https://docs.planning.org.uk/20210319/202/QPV6H7SOJ8900/zisuxgvois9byi3q.pdf)
- Supported protocols include Modbus TCP, DNP3, and REST API for integration with plant controllers and utility interfaces. [impulsoragdl](https://impulsoragdl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ficha-Tecnica-Mega-Pack.pdf)

## Commissioning workflow
- Construction contractor installs, anchors, and wires the Megapack system and tracks progress on a Tesla construction checklist app. [greenburghny](https://www.greenburghny.com/DocumentCenter/View/15305/Commissioning-Plan)
- After the construction checklist and photos are submitted and approved, Tesla performs remote or onsite commissioning, including validation tests and bringing packs to roughly 80% state of charge, which can take 24–48 hours. [greenburghny](https://www.greenburghny.com/DocumentCenter/View/15305/Commissioning-Plan)

## Storage, warranty, and shutdown
- If units will sit more than about 12 months between manufacture and installation, the site manager must coordinate with Tesla to avoid permanent damage and warranty issues. [greenburghny](https://www.greenburghny.com/DocumentCenter/View/15305/Commissioning-Plan)
- If the system is de‑energized after commissioning but before regular use, it must be put into a defined storage shutdown mode from the Operation and Maintenance Manual to protect battery life.
